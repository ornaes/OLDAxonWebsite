                <h6>Hello!</h6>
                <p>We are Team Axon, named after the neural fiber that transmits information to other neurons throughout the human body. The term’s association with people and connectivity seemed particularly appropriate for our name due to the fact that we are working with Cisco toward the goal of connecting people together, apart. We are a team of interdisciplinary Masters of Human-Computer Interaction students, completing the capstone of our program. Working closely with each other we have experienced, first-hand, the pains, the joys and the epiphanies of face-to-face team collaboration. It is our mission to bring the magic of face-to-face communication to the digital realm with this project.</p>
     
                <p>We’ve hit the ground running ever since the very beginning of the semester, all in anticipation of digging into the heart of this topic. Now, with this report, you will be able to come along for the ride to see how we got there.</p>

                <h4 data-magellan-destination="Plan of Attack">Plan of Attack</h4>
                <p>Given the broad scope of our task, we settled on an agile, three- phase approach to our research, which consisted of interviews and contextual inquiries. With each phase, we immediately consolidated and extracted insights from our preliminary findings that guided us to the next stage of research. </p>
                <p>By starting field research immediately and letting it guide our research direction, we let the data—and mostly importantly, the people—speak for themselves.</p>

                <p>The first phase of our research allowed us to observe the landscape of human communication and collaboration both in-person and remotely. During the second phase of our research, we visited professionals in enterprise and startups in Pittsburgh, in order to explore how people operated in industry. In our third and final stage, we visited various Cisco sites and looked at the way they operated, communicated, and collaborated.</p>
